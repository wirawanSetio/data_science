Make clustering on credit card service, and comparing 4 clustering model algorithm to find best result. Data source is from **Hacktive8 BigQuery private server**

comparison been done by manualy analyze the 2D PCA datapoint that visualized with scatter plot, on which data point from the scatterplot that doesn't overlapping each data point.

the algorithms to compare is :

- KMeans
- SpectralClustering
- DBSCAN
- GaussianMixture

using **Python** libraries :
- matplotlib,seaborn (visual)
- pandas (dataframe)
- numpy (matrix operation)
- sklearn (scikit-learn machine learning library)
