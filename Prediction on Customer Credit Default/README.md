make prediction credit default using machine learning and comparing 7 classification supervised machine learning 

the algorithms to compare is :
- Logistic Regression
- SVM classification
- Decission tree 
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Naive Bayess
- XGBoost

comparison was using **Cross Validation** on those 7 base model algorithm, and choose which algorithm that has best accuracy  and consistency


using **Python** libraries :
- matplotlib,seaborn (visual)
- pandas (dataframe)
- numpy (matrix operation)
- sklearn (scikit-learn machine learning library)
