Make clustering on epl football clubs from 2017 - 2020, and comparing 4 clustering model algorithm to find best result [data from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditya2803/premier-league-team-data?select=Shooting+Stats.csv)

the algorithms to compare is :

- KMeans
- SpectralClustering
- DBSCAN
- GaussianMixture

comparison been done by manualy analyze the 2D PCA datapoint that visualized with scatter plot, on which data point from the scatterplot that doesn't overlapping each data point.

using **Python** libraries :
- matplotlib,seaborn (visual)
- pandas (dataframe)
- numpy (matrix operation)
- sklearn (scikit-learn machine learning library)
